# Python Text Editor

Python text editor made in Java.  Essentially it works by making a text editor in Java, 
then saving the file with .py extension and then just opens it. It automatically opens in the command prompt.

I built in some extra commands for running, saving etc. Fun color codes are also made for keywords.

Hope you enjoy.
