# Python Text Editor

Python text editor made in Java.  Essentially it works by making a text editor in Java, 
then saving the file with .py extension and then just opens it. It automatically opens in the command prompt.

I built in some extra commands for running, saving etc.
Please star if you enjoy. 

Hope you enjoy.

COMMANDS:

:r = Save and run <br />
:s = Save only <br />
:l = Lock a file (so you don't have to choose the same file everytime you run) <br />
:u = Unlock the file <br />
:cmd = Opens CMD <br />
:git = Opens git bash <br />
:github = Opens the Github website <br />
:w3 = Opens W3-Schools lol <br />
