# Python Text Editor

Python text editor made in Java.  Essentially it works by making a text editor in Java, 
then saving the file with .py extension and then just opens it. It automatically opens in the command prompt.

I built in some extra commands for running, saving etc. Fun color codes are also made for keywords.

Hope you enjoy.

COMMANDS:

:r = Save and run
:s = Save only
:l = Lock a file (so you don't have to choose the same file everytime you run)
:u = Unlock the file
:cmd = Opens CMD
:git = Opens git bash
:github = Opens the Github website
:w3 = Opens W3-Schools lol
